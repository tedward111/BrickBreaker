This is the classic game Brick Breaker.  In this game, the user controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrows on the keyboard. The goal is to use the paddle to bounce a moving ball into a set of bricks that are located at the top of the screen and to “break” these bricks. 

To run the game, open the final.iml file with IntelliJ, and then navigate to Run > runBrickBreaker.
